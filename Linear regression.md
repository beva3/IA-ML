### âœ… What is Linear Regression?

**Linear regression** is a method to **predict a number** using other numbers.  
It draws a **straight line** to show the **relation between variables**.

Example:  
You want to predict your **weight** from your **height**. Linear regression can help.

---

### âœ… Why use this?

- To **predict values** (price, age, score, etc.).
- To **see trends** in your data.
- To **understand** how one thing affects another.

---

### âœ… How does it work?

- It finds the **best straight line** between points (data).
- This line shows the **relation** between input (X) and output (Y).

---

### âœ… The formula (if linear regression):  
```
y = a1 * x + a0
```

| Element | Name                  | Meaning                                |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `y`     | **Output / Target**   | What we want to predict                |
| `x`     | **Input / Feature**   | The known value (like height, sizeâ€¦)  |
| `a1`    | **Slope / Coefficient** | Shows how much y changes when x changes |
| `a0`    | **Intercept**         | Where the line starts (when x = 0)    |

### âœ… Steps to do linear regression:

1. **Collect data**  
   (X = input, Y = output)

2. **Split data** into:
   - **Train set** (to learn)
   - **Test set** (to check the model)

3. **Scale (normalize)** data (make values similar)

4. **Train the model**  
   Use the train set to find the best line

5. **Predict**  
   Use the line to find Y from new X

6. **Evaluate**  
   Check if the model is good (with error calculation)

Let's make it super easy.

### âœ… Step 2: What does **"Split data"** mean?

It means:  
ðŸ‘‰ We **divide our data** into **two parts**:

- **Training set**: To **teach** the model  
- **Test set**: To **check** if the model works well

Why?  
We want to see if the model can **predict new values** (not just memorize old ones).

### âœ… 3 Easy Examples (with numbers):

#### ðŸ“Š Example 1: Predict weight from height
You have this data:

| Height (x) | Weight (y) |
|------------|------------|
| 150 cm     | 45 kg      |
| 155 cm     | 48 kg      |
| 160 cm     | 52 kg      |
| 165 cm     | 55 kg      |
| 170 cm     | 58 kg      |

**Split:**

- Train: 150, 155, 160 â†’ (to learn)
- Test: 165, 170 â†’ (to test the model)

#### ðŸ“Š Example 2: Predict marks from study hours

| Hours (x) | Marks (y) |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 40        |
| 2         | 50        |
| 3         | 60        |
| 4         | 65        |
| 5         | 70        |

**Split:**

- Train: (1, 2, 3)
- Test: (4, 5)

#### ðŸ“Š Example 3: Predict salary from experience

| Experience (x) | Salary (y) |
|----------------|------------|
| 0              | 30K        |
| 1              | 35K        |
| 2              | 40K        |
| 3              | 50K        |
| 4              | 55K        |

**Split:**

- Train: (0, 1, 2)
- Test: (3, 4)

So the idea is:  
âœ… Use some data to **learn**  
âœ… Use the rest to **test** (check prediction)
