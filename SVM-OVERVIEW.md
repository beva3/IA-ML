Here's a short and simple overview of **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**:

### **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

**SVM** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. However, it is mostly used for **classification**.

#### **Key Idea:**
SVM tries to find the **best boundary (hyperplane)** that separates data points of different classes with the **maximum margin** (distance between the hyperplane and the nearest points from each class).

#### **Important Terms:**
- **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates classes.
- **Support Vectors**: The data points that are closest to the hyperplane. These are critical to defining the margin.
- **Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and support vectors.

#### **Types:**
- **Linear SVM**: When data is linearly separable.
- **Non-linear SVM**: Uses **kernels** (like RBF, polynomial) to handle non-linearly separable data.
